pandas blends the high-performance, array-computing ideas of NumPy with
the flexible data manipulation capabilities of spreadsheets and relational
databases (such as SQL). It provides sophisticated indexing functionality to
make it easy to reshape, slice and dice, perform aggregations, and select
subsets of data. Since data manipulation, preparation, and cleaning is such an
important skill in data analysis, pandas is one of the primary focuses of this
book.
